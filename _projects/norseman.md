A pillar of what dvcoders does is deploy real world projects that benefit Diablo Valley College and it's students. At the very infancy of dvcoders formation we thought of potential project ideas that would have the biggest impact on how student interact with their college. The Norseman and the entire culinary department is a jewel at Diablo Valley College and we are proud to build a website to showcase the capability of the culinary department and our programmers. This was one of our original projects to improve campus life by bridging the gap between information and student. This project was built by two students that have heavily contributed to our clubs success and have been committed since the ICPC.
