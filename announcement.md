This coming semester we have a lot of exciting things planned for everyone! We're not reveal all the secrets, but expect more workshops, projects, and hackathons.

Before the semester starts, there are some changes to be aware of:

#### **Slack**

[dvcoders.slack.com](dvcoders.slack.com) will be deleted on Monday, August 13th and recreated for the fall. This is being done to bypass out 10,000 message limit.

After August 13th you'll be able to rejoin the Slack team through [slack.dvcoders.com](https://slack.dvcoders.com), **do it**, **do it now**! 


#### **Club Meetings**
	
Set to be on **Wednesdays from 5:00-7:00 PM** [17:00-19:00]. 

Our **first unofficial meeting** is scheduled to be Wednesday, September 9th from 5:00-7:00 PM, and every following Wednesday.

Fill out [this form](/apply) to let us know if you're able to make the scheduled time!
	
You can find a list of **all upcoming dvcoders meetings**, along with the topic and agenda, on our [Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=l3fbghmjdfibd36liko10ifgnc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles) (or [iCal Feed](https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/l3fbghmjdfibd36liko10ifgnc%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics))

#### **Feedback**
	
If you would like to give the club officers some feedback about last semester or suggestions for this one, you can email us at [kernel@dvcoders.com](mailto:kernel@dvcoders.com) or grab us in [Slack](dvcoders.slack.com) (preferred).

-Happy coding!
