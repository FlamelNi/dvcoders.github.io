This coming semester we have a lot of exciting things planned for everyone!
We're not reveal all the secrets, but expect more workshops, projects, and
hackathons.

Before the semester starts, there are some changes to be aware of:

1. [dvcoders.slack.com](dvcoders.slack.com) will be deleted on Monday, August 10th and recreated for
   the Fall. This is being done to bypass out 10,000 message limit.

   After August 10th you'll be able to rejoin the Slack team through our
   website, so keep an eye out for dvcoders.com 2.0


2. Club meetings are set to be on Wednesdays from 5:00-7:00 PM [17:00-19:00].
  
   If you're unable to come during this meeting time drop a line at [Jacob
   Young](mailto:jacob@jacobyoung.me). Meeting day/time  will be changed if most
   members cannot attend.
